Name, Section: 
Timothy Ascencio, IGME.202.02


Environment setting: 
Stranded island in the ocean, a plane crash and the only things in site are 
an abandoned airport, crashed planes, and a ferris wheel.
By the ferris wheel there are two button panels.
Button panels rotate (right panel) and destroy (left panel) the ferris wheel.


Type of ride you created: 
Ferris Wheel


Interaction/Instructions:
Naviagate with traditional 'wasd' FPS movement including mouse movement.
Left click on the mouse at any given time to rotate ferris wheel and halt rotation. 
'Press E to interact' is implemented. More details in the Above and Beyond section.

Design Decisions: 
I wanted to make a place where the user felt confused but easy to piece together what happened.
Crashed plane on an island, typical.
Afternoon Island, a place where you landed because you flew a plane all day.
The Island is always in afternoon mode. Spooky!

The crashed planes give an ambience indicating that the player should probably not be here.
Large body of water makes for feeling of strandedness even without previous backstory.
Ferris Wheel spokes are designed to rotate efficiently when prompted by user pressing the button
Indicating that the ferris wheel is functional and responds to user input.

Ferris Wheel chairs are rainbow like, intended to bridge playful thoughts with creepy atmosphere.
The materials have a strong sheen to them, so the spokes and machinery must be clean;
which is strange given that no one is around...

Extra special atmospheric touch by adding text logs onto the building.


Personal challenges in completing this assignment: 
The irritatingly long wait time to start Unity and the even longer wait time to start Visual Studio!
Actually, for the Above and Beyond I had a lot of time put into. I haven't worked with this stuff before and I wanted to make it work.
More detail in my above and beyond section.

Oh and the seat rotation! Pain in the butt. 
When I rotated the ferris wheel my seats were not retaining the axis I wanted them to stick too.
That took more time than I expected.


Requirements not completed: 
Confident that I did everything


Above and Beyond: 
So, ok. I decided that I wanted to blow up my ferris wheel.
When in doubt, blow stuff up. So I applied rigid body whenever the user clicked.
I wasn't satisfied, because I wanted my user to walk up to a pedestal and interact with a button.
I wanted them to feel unnerved about the decision to perform that action; In conjunction with not being sure what the interaction will do.

I decided to do research on Raycasting. Fortunately it was easier than it sounded.
I implemented 'press E to activate' given that the user has a line of sight and is in reasonable range of the button.
The button is located in front of the ferris wheel right in front of a warning sign.

I had a rough time putting text on the screen but I was making it more complicated than necessary.
I just put a Text Mesh on an empty object and assigned it to the warning sign.
